# 🛒 Full Stack E-Commerce Website (MERN)

This is my first full stack MERN project, and it has been an amazing learning journey! The website is a fully functional e-commerce platform with user login, cart functionality, and a dedicated admin panel for managing products.

## 🚀 Features

### 🧑‍💻 User Side

- User Registration & Login (JWT Auth)
- Add to Cart functionality
- Browse Products
- Responsive Design

### 🛠️ Admin Panel

- Add New Products
- List All Products
- Remove Products

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### 🔧 Frontend

- **React.js** – JavaScript library for building interactive UIs
- **Vite** – Fast bundler and development tool for modern frontend
- **Axios** – For handling HTTP requests to the backend

### 🔧 Backend

- **Node.js** – JavaScript runtime environment for backend development
- **Express.js** – Web framework for building REST APIs
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing application data
- **Mongoose** – ODM library to interact with MongoDB in an object-oriented way
- **JSON Web Token (JWT)** – For secure user authentication
- **Multer** – Middleware for handling image/file uploads
- **CORS** – To allow cross-origin resource sharing between client and server
- **Path** – Node.js module for managing file and directory paths

## 📁 Folder Structure (Simplified)

```
frontend/    --> React frontend (with Vite)
admin/       --> React admin interface (with Vite)
backend/     --> Node.js + Express backend
```

## 📌 Learning Highlights

- Learned to structure and manage full stack projects
- Implemented secure JWT-based authentication
- Handled image uploads with Multer
- Created modular components and APIs
- Built responsive UIs using modern tools
